xVehicle v2 - by XpDeviL

Installation information:

- You need to MySQL-r41 and sscanf plugins to use the system.
I've put those into script file. If you already have them ignore it and just install xVehicleV2.amx

- If you want to edit the script you'll also need to MySQL-r41, zcmd, sscanf2 and YSI includes.
I've put those too into script file. If you already have them ignore it.

- logcore.dll and logcore.so files are MySQL plugin's files. If you don't have MySQL plugin, put this in you main gamemode directory.
(If you use Windows put the .dll files, if you use linux put the .so files)

- MySQL tables will be automatically created. Just enter your MySQL informations.
